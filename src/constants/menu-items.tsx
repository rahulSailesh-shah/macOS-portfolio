            I&apos;m Rahul Shah, currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer
            Science at Arizona State University. My coding journey started
            unexpectedly in college, taking a web development elective. Now, as
            a software engineer, I&apos;ve worked on diverse tech projects,
            focusing on improving user experiences.

            Outside of coding, you&apos;ll find me hiking, playing table tennis,
            or brainstorming over coffee. I&apos;m eager to contribute my skills
            to projects that break norms and push boundaries. Let&apos;s create
            something awesome together.
